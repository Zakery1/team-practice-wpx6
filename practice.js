On the second day of Christmas, my true love sent to me, two rabbits rapping. 

On the fifth day of Christmas, my true love sent to me, five foxes asking each other "What does the fox say?".

On the sixth day of Christmas, my true love sent to me, six swans swearing. 

On the eleventh day of Christmas, my true love sent to me, eleven elves suddenly exploding interally from drinking from the magical well that they thought contained kool-aid.
